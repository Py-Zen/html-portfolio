<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm David. I'm studying to be a web developer. I first studied web development 20 years ago during my university days. Back then, I didn't study hard in uni so didn't pursue a career in web development or programming.</p>

<p>But the world has changed so much since then. It's crazy how technology has advanced. Back in those days there was no Youtube or Facebook. The internet was still in it's early days and we didn't have smart phones. I am finding a new found passion as I reconnect the dots back to my roots.</p>

<p>Fun fact: my real name is Py, but I changed my name to David when I was 7 years old. I wanted to have an anglo-saxon name so that I could fit in with all the kids. And you know what another goal of mine is to be a programmer and guess what language - Python!</p>

<p>I think I'm very lucky. I have a beautiful family - I'm married to my wife for 12 years and we have 2 wonderful kids. They are the best kids ever and I'm proud of them. They are such good kids; I'm truly blessed.</p>

<p>Currently, I work as a Desktop Support Officer and my role is very diverse. With all this new modern technologies like Teams, Azure, Microsoft 365, cloud technologies I have grown a lot in the last couple of years. These days my work is always different. I'm involved in a lot of projects and juggle between a lot of tasks. Current main jobs is rolling out and supporting video conferencing systems, SharePoint administration and executive support. By supporting on-site staff it gives me good exposure and experience with understanding people's needs and how they use technology.</p>

<p>OK that's it for now! I didn't think I had so much to write about. I'd like to thank Angela for this course in web development. If not for her, I wouldn't have been motivated to start this journey. Can't wait to see where this leads me</p>
